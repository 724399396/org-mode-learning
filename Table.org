* Tables
Hopefully you can see straight away that the simple structure provided
by org-mode gives a nice way to keep an electronic note book.

Often it is nice to include tables in our notes. Org handles this by
using | to seperate columns, and a line of --- (inserted with C-c -)
to add horizontal lines.

Exercise: start typing in this table below; type the first line inserted verbatim
  1) when you get to the "s" of comments, press TAB to go to the next line
  2) go up to the previous line and use C-c -
  3) next enter a few lines of data, using TAB to go through the
     cells - you should notice the columns changing width as neede

| ID | x |  y | comments       |
|----+---+----+----------------|
| A  | 2 |  4 | blah           |
| B  | 3 |  9 | balh           |
| C  | 4 | 16 | blah blah blah |
| D  | 5 | 25 | blah           |


| ID | x |  y |
